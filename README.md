## Setup
The app is created on Android Studio. How the app works is that once the user has logged in, the app navigates to a page with a google map. The user sets distance parameters that is from pick-up location to prefered destination. Then the app calculates the distance in kms(kilometres), estimates time used to travel the distance and estimates the ride fare. Once done the user can press the call rider button at the bottom of the page and the rider's phone number will be automatically dialled.
